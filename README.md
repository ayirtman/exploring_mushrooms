Mushrooms exist in a variety of different colors, shapes, sizes, textures, etc. This project analyzes an extensive mushroom dataset from UCI using bar charts and acquaints you with the diverse array of mushrooms that exist worldwide.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/73/mushroom) Machine Learning Repository. It is a collection of samples drawn from the multivariate space of mushroom characteristics.

## Objectives
- Investigate the various attributes of mushrooms.
- Analyze the correlation between these attributes.
- Visualize the distribution and variety of mushrooms using bar charts.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Seaborn
- Pandas
